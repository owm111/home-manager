=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* The <<opt-programs.broot.verbs>> option is now a list rather than an
attribute set. To migrate, move the keys of the attrset into the list
items' `invocation` keys. For example,
+
[source,nix]
----
programs.broot.verbs = {
  "p" = { execution = ":parent"; };
};
----
+
becomes
+
[source,nix]
----
programs.broot.verbs = [
  {
    invocation = "p";
    execution = ":parent";
  }
];
----
